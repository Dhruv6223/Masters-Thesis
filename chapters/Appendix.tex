\chapter{Examples of prediction by model in different language\label{results_languages}}
In this section, the results of \acrshort{lilt} on different languages is shown. We include example documents from English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese. The results are not most accurate since the model does not know all languages but it is still able to identify some classes correctly by using layout knowledge learned from fine-tuning in German language dataset. Different classes are colored in different color boxes such as Header is denoted by yellow, Question is denoted by blue,  Answer is denoted by green and Other denoted by violet.
